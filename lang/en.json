    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph1": "Hello! I'm Charlotte, a trainee welder and machinist based in Staffordshire with a growing focus on MIG and TIG welding. I take pride in creating strong, clean, and reliable welds—whether it's for practical builds or finer fabrication work. I came to welding from a very different background, but what drives me is the same: a love for hands-on work, learning new skills, and doing the job right. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow in this trade.",
    "paragraph2": "I believe good welding is about more than strength—it's about precision, patience, and pride in the result."
